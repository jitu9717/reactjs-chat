### Setting up MongoDB

Note: You need MongoDB set up and running to run the code locally. [Installation instructions](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/)

Once you've installed MongoDB start up the MongoDB server in a new terminal with the following commands:

```
mkdir db
mongod --dbpath=./db --smallfiles
```
Now that you've done all that, you can go go ahead and code away!

```
npm start
```
And then point your browser to `localhost:3000`
